model" that is introduced in the first Quantum Mechanics sheet.

## Background

Like all atomic models, the Bohr model attempts to answer the question
"Why do atoms exhibit the properties that they do?", proposing a
mechanical or mathematical description that can produces calculable
predictions that are to be compared against experiment.

Presented in 1913 by Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford, this model builds
on a few recent observations in atomic physics:

* Atoms were known to be able to absorb and emit light, but the spectrum
    of the emitted light consisted of discrete wavelengths. The values
    of these wavelengths are described experimentally by the Rydberg
    formula (1888). For hydrogen, this formula states:

    $$ 1/\lambda = R_H ( 1/n_1^2 - 1 / n_2^2 ) $$

    where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are integers and $R_H$ is a constant.

    Rydberg had no knowledge of electrons (discovered by J. J. Thomson
    in 1897) and gave no physical basis for this experimental law.

* Max Planck (1900), from his work on black-body radiation, had
    postulated that electromatgnetic radiation was conveyed in discrete
    quanta of energy, called photons; the energy of a photon was related
    to its frequency and wavelength by

    $$ E = h f = h c / \lambda $$

    where Planck's constant $ h = 2\pi\hbar $ is an experimental
    constant.

    Planck had little justification for the idea that light was
    quantized, but it proved to produce accurate predictions for the
    spectrum of black-body radiation. Albert Einstein's 1905 work (for
    which he won the 1921 Nobel Prize) gave experimental confirmation of
    the quantization of light into photons.

* The Rutherford model (1911), based on the gold foil experiment,
    established that atoms consist of a heavy central nucleus of positive
    charge, surrounded by a diffusion of negatively charged electrons,
    orbiting the central charge. Joseph Larmor (1897) had previously
    proposed such a 'solar system' model.

Further back, physicists had established the laws of electromagnetism
and electromagnetic radiation (Maxwell 1862), and chemists had known, at
least experimentally, of the regular orbital structure elegantly
illustrated in the periodic table (Mendeleev 1869).


## A new model

A major shortcoming of the 'solar system' model proposed by Larmor and
Rutherford was that it was incompatible with the laws of electromagnetic
radiation, which predicted that an accelerating charge would emit
radiation, causing the electrons to lose energy and to spiral in towards
the nucleus.

To overcome this, Bohr modified the Rutherford model by making three further assumptions (without physical
mechanism):
