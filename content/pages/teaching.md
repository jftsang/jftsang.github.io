I offer a range of teaching and coaching services for maths, physics Python and software engineering. Please [contact me](mailto:j.m.f.tsang@cantab.net) if you are interested in any of these. 


## Cambridge teaching

I teach a number of courses in the [Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad) at Cambridge. I currently offer supervisions in the following courses:

* *Fluid Dynamics I*
* *Methods* ("engineering maths": calculus, Fourier transforms, PDEs)
* *Quantum Mechanics*: [resources](/qm-resources.html) and [posts](/tag/quantum-mechanics.html)
* *Variational Principles* (calculus of variations)

In recent years I have also taught many other courses including

* *Dynamics and Relativity*
* *Mathematical Biology*
* *Probability*

Please note that I do not organise supervisions with Cambridge maths undergraduates directly – please speak to your Director of Studies. 


## Tutoring

I offer 1-1 or group teaching for A level mathematics and further mathematics, and for university preparation including the [STEP exam](https://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/step/about-step/).

I coach Python, as well as tools, techniques and methods of software engineering. I can help you and your teams work more effectively by making use of tools like Git, and the Unix command line.
