<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Jonny Tsang</strong> and I use <em>they</em> pronouns.
I live in Cambridge, UK, and you can email me at
    <code>j dot m dot f dot tsang at cantab dot net</code>.</p>

<p>I'm a Python developer and I also dabble in Java, JavaScript and C++.
</p>

<p>I'm currently employed as a Senior Data Engineer at
    <a href="https://www.audioanalytic.com">Audio Analytic</a>. My things
on GitHub are personal projects, however, unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>I'm a semi-active developer for
    <a href="https://mercurydpm.org/">MercuryDPM</a>, a physics
    simulation package.</p>

<p>I'm a chorister at <a href="https://stclementscambridge.co.uk/">Saint
    Clement's Church, Cambridge</a>, where I wrote
    <a href="https://github.com/jftsang/pypew">PyPew</a>, a Flask web
    app for preparing pew sheets and finding texts in the Book of Common
    Prayer.</p>
