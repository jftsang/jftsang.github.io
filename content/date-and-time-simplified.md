*Time* is taken to be a primitive concept, but can be characterised as a
parameter of a system that allows the system to change, and allows
events to be totally ordered as happening before, simultaneously with, or after each other on a one-dimensional scale (that is, a timeline). The
English word *time* may refer either to an absolute position on such a
scale ("what time is it?"), or to a distance between two positions on
the timeline ("how much time has passed?").
