Slug: teaching

I teach, or have taught, a number of courses in the [Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad) at Cambridge. In recent years I have taught courses in Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Methods, Calculus of Variations, and Probability.

I also offer 1-1 or group teaching for A level mathematics and further mathematics, or for university preparation (the [STEP maths exam](https://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/step/about-step/)); as well as coaching in Python (and occasionally other languages too).
