This page lists things possibly of interest to my Part IB _Quantum Mechanics_ students. It will be updated from time to time.

## Books

* Alexandre Zagoskin, *Quantum Mechanics: A Complete Introduction: Teach Yourself*. ISBN 9781473602410. 
  
  Covers a lot of physicsy material but a bit light on the maths. Starts from classical physics and has important notes about the history and philosophy of quantum mechanics.
  
* Leonard Susskind, *Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum*. ISBN 978-0465036677. 
 
  Takes an axiomatic, mathematical approach and very useful for going from this course to Part II _Principles of Quantum Mechanics_, although the approach is a bit different from the one taken in this courses. Also available as [video lectures](https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/quantum-mechanics/2012/winter).

* David Tong's [lecture notes](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/quantum.html) and [book](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/books/quantum.html).

* Eugene Lim's [notes](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/eugene.lim/teach/QM2012/QMroot.html) on an older version of this course. *Dead link – I shall try to find an archived version.*

### Videos

The [Looking Glass Universe](https://www.youtube.com/@LookingGlassUniverse) channel by Mithuna Yonagathan has excellent explanations for quantum mechanical phenomena.

* [I did the double slit experiment at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_uBaBuarEM&t=6s)
* [The biggest lie about the double slit experiment](https://youtu.be/fbzHNBT0nl0?si=Oh44kP2wUOhUJv1d)
* ["Standard" quantum mechanics is obviously wrong](https://youtu.be/hIvuxx14zCk?si=SNHCSgPpcb1A6eiD) – on problems with the Copenhagen interpretation.

[FloatHeadPhysics](https://www.youtube.com/@mahesh_shenoy) has some excellent videos that try to make physics concepts intuitive and logical. He has a [playlist of videos about quantum mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLawLaqps30oCiv24vBDZeNM5nmJ157shS).


### Demos

[Paul Falstad's Math, Physics and Engineering applets](https://www.falstad.com/mathphysics.html) has several demos related to quantum mechanics (and many other physics-y things).

 For Pythonistas, I made a bunch of interactive demos for various courses that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/jftsang/ibmethods-demos).
