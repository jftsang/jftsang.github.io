## Cambridge teaching

I teach, or have taught, a number of courses in the [Mathematical Tripos](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/undergrad) at Cambridge. 

I currently offer supervisions in the following courses:

In recent years I have also taught many courses including

* Dynamics and Relativity
* Mathematical Biology
* Methods (calculus, Fourier transforms, PDEs)
* Probability


## Tutoring

I offer 1-1 or group teaching for A level mathematics and further mathematics, and for university preparation including the [STEP exam](https://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/step/about-step/))

I teach Python and occasionally other languages.
