and in recent years have also taught courses including

* Dynamics and Relativity
* Mathematical Biology
* Methods (calculus, Fourier transforms, PDEs)

## Tutoring

I offer 1-1 or group teaching for A level mathematics and further mathematics, and for university preparation including the [STEP exam](https://www.admissionstesting.org/for-test-takers/step/about-step/))

I teach Python and occasionally other languages.
