  <div>
    <p>In the <a href="uncertainty-principle-obvious-to-musicians">previous post</a> I discussed how, when measuring the frequency (tempo) of a signal that itself changes in time, there is necessarily a tradeoff between the precision in the measured frequency and precision in the time at which the measurement is taken: A more precise measurement of frequency requires that the sample be taken over a longer period of time. This is particularly well demonstrated in signal processing and spectrograms.</p>
<h2>Fourier decomposition</h2>
<p>Recall first of all that any signal can be decomposed into its frequency components: this is the Fourier transform. Pure tones, which consist of a single frequency component, are given by sine waves. Most instruments do not produce pure tones when they play a note; instead, they play a mixture of tones, which together give the unique timbre of the instrument.</p>
<p>For example, this is an A5 played on an alto recorder:
<audio src="static/APlayedOnTrebleRecorder.wav" controls></audio></p>
<p>Its spectrum, given by taking a Fourier transform of the signal, looks like this [[ref]By convention, both axes are drawn on logarithmic scales. The relative amplitudes are measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel">decibels</a>, a logarithmic unit; 0 dB corresponds to the maximum amplitude that can be represented by the file format.[/ref]]:</p>
<p><img src="images/SpectrumOfRecorderA5.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Spectrum of the recorder. Note the log scales.</p>
<p>The spectrum consists of a peak around f = 880 Hz (slightly lower in this example), which is the fundamental frequency for A5, along with further, smaller peaks, at integer multiples of f = 880 Hz ('overtones' or 'harmonics'). The overall sound is periodic with frequency 880 Hz, giving a tonal sound.</p>
<h2>Varying pitch</h2>
<p>Most music consists of more than one note. [[ref]<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWVUp12XPpU">John Cage might disagree.</a>[/ref]]</p>
<p><audio src="static/FrereJacque.wav" controls></audio></p>
<p>If you wanted to analyse the notes in that track, taking the Fourier transform of the entire track is not particularly interesting.</p>
<p><img src="images/SpectrumOfMelody.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Spectrum of the entire recording.</p>
<p>This spectrogram contains contributions from <em>all</em> the notes in the track. This is like measuring pulse by sampling the heartbeat over a whole day: it gives no information about the pulse at any given time. This playthrough was in F major; some notes (F and C) were played more often than other notes, so there are still peaks at those notes, but all other detail has been lost.</p>
<p>It is much more useful to work with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform">short-time Fourier transform</a> (STFT). At each timestep, take a Fourier transform of the part of the signal around that time. [[ref]To avoid edge effects, a window function is usually applied to smooth the signal. Audacity uses the Hann window by default, SciPy uses Tukey. The <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.get_window.html">SciPy docs</a> have many other examples.[/ref]] The STFT is a function of both time and frequency, so it is usually visualised as a spectrogram:</p>
<p><img src="images/SpectrogramOfMelody.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Spectrogram of the above recording (window size 2048 with Hann smoothing). Time on the horizontal axis, frequency (logarithmic) on the vertical axis, colour intensity for amplitude.</p>
<p>As seen, each note consists of an intense fundamental frequency alongside a stack of harmonics.</p>
<p>As with the pulse measurement procedure in the last post, the length of the window over which the spectrogram is taken is a free parameter. The effect of this parameter is very well illustrated by the following example.</p>
<h2>Two tones</h2>
<p>Consider a signal consisting of a 1 second tone at 400 Hz followed by a 1 second tone at 800 Hz. The signal is sampled at 16 kHz.</p>
<p><audio src="static/TwoTones.wav" controls></audio></p>
<p>The waveform is a sine wave for 0 &lt; t &lt; 1, and a higher-frequency sine wave for 1 &lt; t &lt; 2. For simplicity, the phases are aligned so that the wave is continuous at t = 1.</p>
<p><img src="images/TwoToneSignal.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The spectrograms when the window size is 256, 1024 and 4096 (with Tukey smoothing). These correspond to intervals of 16 ms, 64 ms and 256 ms respectively.</p>
<p><img src="images/TwoToneSpectrograms.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Spectrograms of the two tones for window sizes 256, 1024, 4096</p>
<p>The tradeoff between precision in frequency and precision in time is now very visible.</p>
<p>Away from the transition at t = 1, the larger the window for the STFT the more precise the estimate for frequency will be: thus the first spectrogram contains wide bands, since the narrowest window spans only about 6 periods, while the last spectrogram has thinnest bands since the widest window spans over 100 periods.</p>
<p>However, near t = 1, the window for the STFT contains samples from both t &lt; 1 (at 400 Hz) and from t &gt; 1 (at 800 Hz), so the computed STFT contains components from both. The region that is affected by this is largest for the widest window. Thus, a STFT with a wider window does a poorer job of detecting the time at which a frequency transition occurs.</p>
